## Notes on compilation:

1.  Make sure you have the ``rmarkdown`` package.

2. After cloning the repo., navigate to the Manuscript subdirectory.

2.  Compile the source .Rmd files by typing ``Rscript stitchManuscript.R``.

3.  html, .docx, .tex, and .pdf files will be produced (e.g., ``stitched.pdf``).
